# Schrödingers Labyrinth

"Schrödingers Labyrinth" is part of my master-thesis:

"**Simulating a tilting maze using the Schrödinger Equation to illustrate quantum mechanical principles**" [(PDF Download)](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agebv/downloads/published/brenig_thesis_21.pdf)

> Abstract—Quantum mechanics is notorious for being a difficult
> topic to grasp. Schrödingers Labyrinth is a game inspired by a
> tilting marble labyrinth. Using a numerical simulation of the
> Schrödinger equation the marble is replaced by a quantum
> particle to teach about quantum mechanical concepts. The wave
> function of a quantum particle is simulated on the GPU, which
> allows for a real-time experience with complex potentials. Players
> can directly influence the simulation and can immediately observe
> how the wave function reacts to their inputs.
